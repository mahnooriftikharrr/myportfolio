<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Mahnoor, a Computer Science major at Pacific Lutheran University and a passionate advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion in tech. 🚀</p>
<p>Now, as a college student, I juggle 3 campus jobs while maintaining a strong GPA and earning a place on the Dean’s List. 
I'm dedicated to creating access for others especially women and girls who are told that certain doors aren’t meant for them. 🌸</p>
</p>I’ve launched STEM clubs, help set up Computer Labs for girls in underserved schools in Karachi, 
founded women-in-tech communities on my college campus, and now lead bridgebuilding and social impact projects that bring people together across backgrounds and beliefs.</p>

<p>Along the way, I’ve:</p>

<ul>
<li>AI/ML Research Assistant — worked on improving protein-function prediction models by integrating PyTorch, ESM-3 embeddings, and BigBird transformers, advancing research at the intersection of biology and machine learning.</li>
<li>HackMIT ’25 — got selected for my first hackathon with a 4% acceptance rate & built TwoStep, an adaptive music therapy platform that supports gait rehabilitation for people with Parkinson’s disease through rhythmic auditory stimulation.</li>
<li>Founder & President, NMDP Chapter @ PLU — Set chapter strategy, secured a faculty advisor, led 9 member exec board, and securing $1000+ in funding and adding 200+ new registry members and reaching 500+ students.</li>
<li>Tech Intern, Code for Pakistan — Developed a web application using React.js and Node.js to streamline volunteer coordination, enhancing project efficiency and community engagement.</li>
<li>BRAID Fellow (Interfaith America) — I earned $3K+ in grants and scholarships + 2 Fully Funded Leadership Conference's in Salt Lake City & Chicago to design bridgebuilding programs that foster inclusion, dialogue, and belonging across campus, while receiving intensive leadership and project-management training.</li>
</ul>


<p>🎤 I’ve also been honored with the Emerging Leader Award, Rieke Scholarship, flown out to 5 fully funded leadership conferences and received invitations to speak on national panels and deliver my university’s convocation address, moments that remind me why I do what I do.</p>

<p>At my core, I’m passionate about building technology and communities that empower and about designing products, systems, and experiences that make access equitable, intuitive, and lasting.

✨ Because when one woman breaks a barrier, she holds the door open for many more to walk through.</p>
